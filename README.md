Hello

I was interested which german football club generates the most views from highlight videos in germany. So i created a data mining project where i collect the views of every highlight video from the "sportstudio fu√üball" channel. 
I used this channel because they create a highlight video of every match in the Bundesliga and are the most viewed in germany. The files synonyms.txt and playlist_urls.txt are handmade with some assistance of python that i coded
somewhere else. These are needed for the code to work. 2 variables are set differently depending on what i want to do: collect is True when i want to go over every video again and collect to most recent viewcount. These values
are stored in the data_raw.txt file. override is true when i want to override the current version of the data_comprensive.txt and the home_away_dict.txt file or create them if they dont exist.

This is my first data mining project if you can call it that so the code was incredibly ugly and unreadable. I cleaned it up a bit so you know what part does what but actually understanding the functions is probably pretty
difficult.

Thank you for reading
