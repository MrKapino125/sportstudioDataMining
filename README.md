Hello

I was interested which german football club generates the most views from highlight videos in germany. So i created a data mining project where i collect the views of every highlight video from the "sportstudio fu√üball" channel. 
I used this channel because they create a highlight video of every match in the Bundesliga and are the most viewed in germany.

Look at the releases for more Info.

This is my first data mining project if you can call it that so the code was incredibly ugly and unreadable. I cleaned it up a bit so you know what part does what but actually understanding the functions is probably pretty
difficult.

Thank you for reading
